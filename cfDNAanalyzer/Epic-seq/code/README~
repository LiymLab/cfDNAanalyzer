EPIC-Seq: Developed by M.S.Esfahani, et al. [Alizadeh and Diehn laboratories at Stanford University 2021]
=========
For additional details, see:

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Unix operating system (Linux, Mac OS X, etc.).

R (tested with version 3.6+), with fitdistrplus library.

Python (>=2.6: only sys and numpy)

SAMtools (version: 1.3.1)

bedtools (version: v2.26.0)

[for samtools and bedtools]: copy/link/move to PATH (i.e., /usr/bin).

USAGE
=====

Step I: Featurization
=====================


Rscript runEPIC.R –-bamdir <path to directory> –-tssinfo <path to file> –-panelbed <path to file> –-targeted <character; yes or no> –-outdir <path to output directory> –-mapq <min MAPQ> –-groupref <character> –-groupsize <double, number of genes per group> –-skipHist <binary, 0 or 1> –-skipOCFFrags <binary, 0 or 1>

Input files:
-----------
	     --bamdir
		Directory of bam files.
	     --tssinfo
		A tab-delimited file for TSS coordinates. This file has five columns: CHR, TSS, Gene-Symbol, Category, Strand, TS_ID. Category is either "negativeControl", or anyother strings. 
             --panelbed 
	        BED file. In selector design, certain parts of the 2kb around the TSSs might not be fully covered. This file would provide that information for the feature calculations.
	     --targeted 
	        yes [for EPIC-seq] and no [for whole genome]
             --outdir
	        Directory for writing output files.
             --mapq [default: 30]
	        Minimum mapping quality.
             --groupref [default: "pbmc_genome"]
	        "pbmc_genome" or "pbmc_exome". This is only important for the cases where genes are grouped according to some reference expression profile.
	     --groupsize [default: 0]
	        Number of genes per group [related to groupref]
	     --skipHist [default: 0]
	        0 or 1. This will skip the 'samtools view' step, assuming that files are already generated. 
	     --skipOCFFrags [default: 0]
	        0 or 1. This will skip the fragment information extraction for OCF calculations. 
              

Output:
------
Multiple directories are generated (e.g., window_upstream1000_downstream_1000). These directories correspond to different windows around the TSSs for PFE and NDR calculations. The final feature file is 'epicseq.features.merged.by.[k].txt' where k is 0 if data is targeted or no grouping is performed for WGS.  

Step II: Gene expression inference
==================================


Rscript runGEPModel.R –xnewpath <path to the features> --tssinfo <path to TSS info file> --outdir <output directory>

Input files:
-----------
	   --xnewpath 
	      Path to the feature file generated above.
	   --tssinfo 
	      A tab-delimited file for TSS coordinates. This file has five columns: CHR, TSS, Gene-Symbol, Category, Strand, TS_ID. Category is either "negativeControl", or anyother strings.
	   --outdir
	      Directory for writing output files.
Output:
------
Output file is a tab-delimited file [EPICSeqInferredExpressionValues.txt] where each row corresponds to one TSS in the tssinfo file. The inferred expression column is shown by 'inferredGEP'.
